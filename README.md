# WT Smart Contracts

Smart contracts of the Winding Tree platform.

The smart contracts in the [hotel folder](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-contracts/tree/master/contracts/hotel) and
[airline folder](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-contracts/tree/master/contracts/airline) are representing
inventory registered in the Winding Tree platform. The registries themselves are `WTHotelIndex` and `WTAirlineIndex`
smart contracts.

For interaction with those from your application, you can use the `Abstract*` smart contracts
whose [JSON ABI](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html#json)s are significantly
smaller (86 kB vs 500 kB in case of `WTHotelIndex`).

## Requirements

Node 10 is required for running the tests and contract compilation.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @windingtree/wt-contracts
```

```js
import HotelContractMetadata from '@windingtree/wt-contracts/build/contracts/AbstractHotel.json';
// or
import { AbstractHotelContract, AbstractWTHotelIndexContract } from '@windingtree/wt-contracts';
```

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/windingtree/wt-contracts
nvm install
npm install
npm test
```

You can run a specific test with `npm test -- test/WTHotel.js`
or you can generate a coverage report with `npm run coverage`.

### Flattener

A flattener script is also available, and by running `npm run flattener`,
you cancreate a flattened version of the contracts without imports in
one single file for all contracts in the contracts folder.
This is needed if you plan to use tools like [etherscan verifier](https://etherscan.io/verifyContract)
or [securify.ch](https://securify.ch/).

## Deployment

We are using the upgradeability proxy from [zos](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/)
and the deployment pipeline is using their system as well. You can read more
about the [publishing process](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/deploying) and
[upgrading](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/upgrading.html) in `zos`
documentation.

In order to interact with "real" networks such as `mainnet`, `ropsten` or others,
you need to setup a `keys.json` file used by [truffle](https://truffleframework.com/)
that does the heavy lifting for zos.

```json
{
  "mnemonic": "<SEED_PHRASE>",
  "infura_apikey": "<API_KEY>"
}
```

### Local testing

You don't need `keys.json` file for local testing of deployment and interaction
with the contracts.

1. Start a local Ethereum network.
    ```bash
    > npm run testrpc
    ```
2. Start a zos session.
    ```bash
    > ./node_modules/.bin/zos session --network development --from 0x87265a62c60247f862b9149423061b36b460f4bb --expires 3600
    ```
3. Deploy your contracts. This only uploads the logic, the contracts are not meant to be directly
interacted with.
    ```bash
    > ./node_modules/.bin/zos push --network development
    ```
4. Create the proxy instances of deployed contracts you can interact with. The `args`
attribute is intended as a reference to an actual instance of [Lif token](https://github.com/windingtree/lif-token),
but you don't need for simple local testing for now.
    ```bash
    > ./node_modules/.bin/zos create WTHotelIndex --network development --init initialize --args 0xfBc580bb54172F4F76E74Bc86E505c5acDa871c3
    > ./node_modules/.bin/zos create WTAirlineIndex --network development --init initialize --args 0xfBc580bb54172F4F76E74Bc86E505c5acDa871c3
    ```
These commands will return a network address where you can actually interact with the contracts.
For a quick test, you can use the truffle console.
```bash
> ./node_modules/.bin/truffle console --network development
truffle(development)> contract = await WTHotelIndex.at('0x839c960087942a82636e191d9a7ed6145582cfac')
undefined
truffle(development)> contract.getHotels()
[ '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' ]
truffle(development)> contract.registerHotel('http://windingtree.com')
truffle(development)> contract.getHotels()
[ '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x4D377b0a8fa386FA118B09947eEE2B1f7f126C76' ]
```

Documentation is in the [`docs`](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-contracts/tree/master/docs)
folder and can be generated by running `npm run soldoc`.
